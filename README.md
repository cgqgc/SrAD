This is the official implementation code of "A self-refine strategy for reconstruction-based anomaly detection in medical image segmentation"

Due to confidentiality concerns and since the improvements in this paper are made at the inference stage, the inference code is temporarily not open-sourced. Once the paper is accepted, we will release the complete code for reproducibility.
